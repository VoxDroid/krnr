# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

krnr is actively maintained and security updates are provided for supported releases. We recommend using the latest release to ensure you have the most recent fixes.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in krnr, we encourage responsible disclosure to protect our users. We take security seriously and appreciate your help.

### How to Report
- **Preferred Method**: Email the maintainers at [izeno.contact@gmail.com](mailto:izeno.contact@gmail.com) with a clear description of the vulnerability and steps to reproduce it (if known). Please include the potential impact and any suggested mitigations.
- **Alternative**: Use the [Security Report issue template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/security_report.yml) on the [Issues page](https://github.com/VoxDroid/krnr/issues). We recommend private reporting via email to avoid public disclosure before a fix is available.
- **Sensitive Matters**: For highly sensitive issues, open a private issue labeled "Security Violation" on the repository so only maintainers see it.

### What to Expect
- **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours.
- **Investigation**: We will investigate within 7 days and prioritize critical issues.
- **Resolution**: If confirmed, we will prepare and release a fix as soon as feasible and coordinate disclosure.
- **Credit**: With your permission, we may credit you in release notes or an advisory for responsible disclosure.

### Guidelines
- **Responsible Disclosure**: Do not publicly disclose the vulnerability until a fix is available and disclosure is coordinated.
- **No Exploitation**: Do not exploit vulnerabilities in ways that harm users or the project.
- **Follow Community Standards**: Adhere to our [Contributing Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) and [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Avoid including unverified links or promotional content in reports.

## Security Best Practices
- Always use the latest release (see [Releases](https://github.com/VoxDroid/krnr/releases)).
- Keep your toolchain (Go, OS packages) up to date.
- Run krnr in a secure environment and avoid exposing sensitive credentials.

## Contact
For security-related questions or follow-ups, email [izeno.contact@gmail.com](mailto:izeno.contact@gmail.com) or open a private issue labeled "Security Violation."
