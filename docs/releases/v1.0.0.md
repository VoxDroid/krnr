# Release notes — v1.0.0 (2026-01-11)

Summary

v1.0.0 is the first stable major release candidate for `krnr`. This release focuses on stability, packaging readiness, and a set of productivity features that improve discoverability and organization of saved command sets.

Highlights

- Tagging & Search UI
  - `krnr tag add|remove|list` to manage tags on command sets.
  - `krnr list --tag <tag>` to filter results by tag.
- Text & Fuzzy Search
  - `krnr list --filter <text>` performs a substring search across name, description, commands, and tags.
  - `krnr list --filter <text> --fuzzy` enables case-insensitive subsequence fuzzy matching (helpful for short queries and typos).
- Parameters & Variable Substitution
  - Use `{{param}}` in saved commands and provide values at runtime via `--param name=value`.
  - Support for `env:VAR` lets you load parameter values from environment variables (e.g., `--param user=env:USER`).
  - Missing parameters are prompted interactively when running in a terminal; integration tests cover these flows.
- Tests & Docs
  - Unit tests and CLI integration tests were added for tags, search, and fuzzy behavior.
  - `docs/cli.md` updated with flag descriptions and examples.
- Stability & Packaging
  - Cross-platform tests exercised on Windows, Linux, and macOS.
  - Packaging manifests and CI release validation are in place (see `packaging/` and CI workflows).

Upgrade notes

- No database schema migrations are required for this release — tagging and fuzzy search are implemented in a backward-compatible way.
- Recommended: run the test suite on your environment after upgrading and review CLI examples in `docs/cli.md`.

Usage examples

- List command sets with the `utils` tag:

  krnr list --tag utils

- Fuzzy search for items similar to `demo` (matches `dmo` with `--fuzzy`):

  krnr list --filter dmo --fuzzy

Contributors

- Core implementation and tests: contributors in `git` history (see `git shortlog -sne` for details).

Questions & Follow-ups

- Consider future fuzzy algorithm improvements (e.g., scoring, top-k ranking, or leveraging an indexed approach for large datasets).
- Potential follow-ups: add `krnr search` subcommand with richer options and pagination.
