# Release notes — v1.1.0 (2026-01-12)

Summary

v1.1.0 focuses on CLI UX polish and portable import/export capabilities. This patch release improves interactive flows and adds robust import policies while keeping backward compatibility.

Highlights

- Save UX
  - `krnr save` now warns and prompts for a different name when the provided name already exists, avoiding DB constraint errors and aligning behavior with `krnr record`.
- Export & Import
  - `krnr export db --dst <file>` exports the active database to a portable SQLite file (performs a WAL checkpoint for consistency).
  - `krnr export set <name> --dst <file>` exports a single named command set to a minimal SQLite file.
  - `krnr import db <file> [--overwrite]` imports a database file; `--overwrite` replaces the active DB if present.
  - `krnr import set <file> [--on-conflict=rename|skip|overwrite|merge] [--dedupe]` imports a single exported set into the active DB. Conflict strategies:
    - `rename` (default): append `-import-N` to avoid name collisions
    - `skip`: do not import a set when a name collision exists
    - `overwrite`: replace the existing set with the imported set
    - `merge`: append incoming commands to the existing set; record a new version snapshot
  - Use `--dedupe` with `merge` to remove exact-duplicate commands when merging.
- Interactive CLI
  - Running `krnr export` or `krnr import` with no arguments launches an interactive prompt to choose `db` or `set`, provide paths, and configure `--on-conflict` and `--dedupe` options. Non-interactive flags remain supported.
- Tests & Docs
  - Unit and integration tests for `--on-conflict` policies, merge/dedupe behavior, export/import round-trips, and interactive flows added.
  - `docs/cli.md` and `docs/importer.md` were updated with examples and flag descriptions.

Upgrade notes

- No DB schema changes are required for these changes; imports operate within the existing schema and record new versions when necessary.
