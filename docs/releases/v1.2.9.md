# v1.2.9 - 2026-02-20

This patch fixes a TUI/status reporting bug where system installs could be reported as "on PATH" even when the `krnr` binary was not present in the system location. The TUI now reports PATH membership only when the corresponding `krnr` binary is actually present (or resolvable), preventing false-positives in status diagnostics.

## Bug fixes

- **TUI / status:** Do not report `on PATH: true` for system/user installs solely because the target directory appears in PATH; require the `krnr` binary to be present at the expected location (or be resolvable via LookPath) before reporting `on PATH`.
- **Installer tests:** Added coverage for directory-on-PATH but missing-binary scenarios.

## Tests & docs
- Added tests to validate that `krnr status` does not report false-positives when directories are on PATH but binaries are missing.
- Updated `docs/install.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` (see v1.2.9 entry).

## Upgrade notes
- No functional or breaking changes; upgrade to v1.2.9 for more accurate installer/status diagnostics.
