# v1.2.0 (Planned)

**Status:** Long-term initiative — TUI (terminal UI) integration

Summary

This release (v1.2.0) is planned as a larger, long-term effort to provide a first-class Terminal User Interface (TUI) for krnr. The TUI will be an *add-on* UI layer that complements the existing CLI—users will still be able to use and script the CLI as before, while power users and beginners can benefit from an interactive visual client.

Goals

- Provide interactive screens for the most common workflows: browse command sets, view details and history, run workflows (with parameter entry), inspect run logs, rollback, import/export sets, edit entries, and manage tags.
- Reuse existing business logic and packages — the TUI will call into `internal/registry`, `internal/executor`, `internal/importer/exporter`, and other core packages rather than duplicating logic.
- Deliver a keyboard-first, accessible UX with theming and helpful keyboard docs (help modal, `?` keybindings).
- Add headless UI tests (pseudo-ttys) and CI jobs to validate rendering, interaction, and flows on Windows/Linux/macOS.
- Provide documentation and packaging adjustments so that `krnr tui` is a supported and documented entrypoint.

Scope & parity

- The TUI project scope includes interactive equivalents for all existing CLI commands and workflows including: `save`, `edit`, `run` (with parameter entry and streaming logs), `list`, `describe`, `history`, `rollback`, `import/export`, `tag` add/remove/list, `install`/`uninstall`, and `status`.
- The CLI remains the canonical scripting/automation interface (unchanged); the TUI is a user-facing, interactive client that delegates to the same internal packages used by the CLI.

Planned milestones

1. Prototype PoC (Bubble Tea) — completed: `cmd/tui` (list + detail PoC)
2. Design `internal/tui` architecture and adapters — separate rendering from business logic and define testable models
3. Implement core features in TUI: list, detail, run modal (with dry-run), streaming logs viewport, rollback, import/export, edit, tags
4. Add headless UI tests and CI matrix to run TUI checks in the test suite
5. Accessibility & theming work (high-contrast theme, keyboard navigation, screen reader considerations)
6. Docs and user guide: `docs/cli.md` updates and a TUI-specific guide with screenshots and keyboard reference
7. Packaging and release notes (update release manifests, installers, and README to advertise the TUI)

Acceptance criteria

- `krnr tui` is documented and available in the CLI help
- Users can perform common workflows via `krnr tui` with parity for interactive flows; CLI scripting remains the canonical automation path
- UI models are unit tested and headless UI tests run successfully in CI on supported platforms

Notes

- This is a long-term initiative; the scope will evolve as we iterate on UX and concrete user feedback.
- The implementation will favor testability and reuse — UI code will focus on rendering and user interaction while delegating business logic to existing packages.
