# v1.2.0 - 2026-01-17 (Initial TUI release)

**Status:** Released — Initial TUI functionality shipped and documented

Summary

This release (v1.2.0) delivers the initial Terminal UI (`krnr tui`) that provides interactive equivalents for core CLI workflows. The TUI is an interactive client that delegates to the same internal packages used by the CLI, preserving the CLI as the canonical scripting surface.

What shipped

- Browse & search (`krnr list`) with filter and fuzzy search
- Preview panel & full-screen details (`krnr describe` behavior)
- `krnr run` with parameter prompting, dry-run preview, and streaming logs viewport
- Save/create/edit modals for command sets
- Import/export helpers for sets and DB (interactive flows)
- History viewing and rollback UI
- Installer views for `install`/`uninstall` dry-run planning and `status` diagnostics
- Headless UI unit tests and PTY-based E2E tests (CI runs headless tests and PTY E2E where supported)

Implementation notes

- UI implementation: `cmd/tui` (Bubble Tea model)
- UI model and adapters: `internal/tui` keeps UI thin and testable while reusing `internal/registry`, `internal/executor`, and `internal/importer/exporter`.
- Docs: `docs/cli.md` updated with `krnr tui` documentation; `krnr_docs/TUI_MILESTONE.md` updated to reflect release; release notes added under `RELEASE_NOTES/GITHUB_v1.2.0.md`.

Acceptance & verification

- `krnr tui` is documented and discoverable via `krnr --help` and `docs/cli.md`.
- Headless UI unit tests added; PTY-based E2E test added and run on supported platforms (skips on unsupported platforms).

Notes

- Future work: expand PTY CI coverage, parameter editor polish, accessibility theming, screen-reader improvements, and packaging manifest updates to highlight the new TUI entrypoint.
