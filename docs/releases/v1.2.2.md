# v1.2.2 - 2026-01-17

This patch release fixes a subtle behavior where comma-containing commands (common in PowerShell cmdlets like `Select-Object`) could be split into multiple saved commands when supplied via a single `-c` flag. The CLI now preserves a single quoted `-c` value exactly (it no longer splits on commas).

Highlights

- Fix: Preserve comma-containing `-c` values (e.g., `Get-ComputerInfo | Select-Object OsName, OsVersion, OsArchitecture`) as a single saved command.
- Internal: Use `StringArray` for the repeatable `-c`/`--command` flag to avoid unintended comma splitting caused by `StringSlice`.
- Tests: Added unit tests to assert preservation of comma-containing commands and improved save-related tests to be robust to shell tokenization edge cases.
- Docs: Updated `docs/cli.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` to document the fix and provide upgrade guidance.

Upgrade guidance: Simply upgrade to v1.2.2; no DB schema changes are required. When using Windows shells, prefer quoting `-c` values fully (e.g., `-c 'Get-ComputerInfo | Select-Object OsName, OsVersion, OsArchitecture'`) to avoid any shell-level splitting. If you rely on previously-split behavior, re-save the affected command sets after upgrading.
